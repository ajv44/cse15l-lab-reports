<br>

*Keys Pressed*: I pressed `<up><enter>` because the SSH command was up 1 in my history.

<br>

*Summary*: The command essentially connects to the server at school.

<br>

<br>

*Keys Pressed*: I typed `git clone` then pressed `<Command-V>` to paste the SSH URL for the repository.

<br>

*Keys Pressed*: First I typed `cd lab7` then `bash test.sh`.

<br>

*Summary*: This first command changes to the `/lab7` directory that we got from the previous step. The next command executes a script. 

<br>

<br>

*Keys Pressed*: First, I typed `vim ListExamples.java` then I pressed and held `<j>` until I was on line 44. Then I pressed and held `<l>` until I was on the '1' in index1. I pressed `<x>`, `<i>`, then typed '2'. Then I pressed `<esc>` and typed`<:wq!>`.

<br>

*Summary*: To access the vim editor, we need to type `vim <filename>` which is what I did above. The `<j>` and `<l>` are strictly for navigating to the desired location, which in this case was on line 44. `<x>` is used to delete a character. `<i>` puts the editor into INSERT mode and `<esc>` leaves this mode. `<:wq!>` is used to save the changes and exit the vim editor.

<br>

*Keys Pressed*: I pressed `<up><up><up>` because the command was up 3 in my history.

<br>

*Summary*: This command executes the same script as **Step 6**.

<br>

<br>

*Keys Pressed*: I first typed `git add .` then pressed `<enter>`. Next, I typed `git commit -m "lab report 4"` then pressed `<enter>`. Lastly, I typed `git push` then pressed `<enter>`

<br>

*Summary*: `git add .` adds all of the changes in the current directory and its subdirectories to the staging area. `git commit -m "lab report 4"` commits the changes with the commit message in quotations. `git push` pushes those changes.
